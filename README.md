# JARVIS UI
A mobile UI like Karvis with a fully graphical interface and voice interactions would include:

Home Screen (Main Dashboard)

A futuristic, animated interface with a central AI avatar (could be a holographic head, an abstract AI core, or a 3D assistant).
Dynamic background with smooth animations and subtle UI transitions.
A circular or waveform-based voice activity indicator to show when the AI is speaking or listening.
Voice Interaction

The AI welcomes the user with a voice message when the app is launched (e.g., "Hello [User's Name], how can I assist you today?").
It listens for commands either through a wake word or by pressing a microphone button.
Responses are spoken back using a natural-sounding AI voice.
Graphical Elements

Live Data Widgets: Time, weather, notifications, battery percentage, system stats (for PC mode).
Holographic Effects: UI elements that give a sci-fi or HUD-like feel (e.g., glowing text, transparent overlays, animated circuits).
3D/2D Avatar: A customizable assistant that can visually react (eye movement, expressions, animations).
User Commands & Responses

Users can ask questions, control smart devices, check messages, or perform tasks (e.g., open apps, set reminders).
AI responds with a mix of voice and graphical elements, such as displaying weather info with animations.
Customization Options

Change UI colors, themes, and assistant voice.
Select different AI avatars or effects.
Would you like me to design a UI layout or provide a code implementation for any part of this?

# Notes:
Replace YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY and YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY with your actual API keys.
The listening feature runs in the background, so it won't block the UI.
You can extend the command processing logic to add more features as per your original React version.
Let me know if you'd like further assistance or modifications!
