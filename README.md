# JARVIS UI
A mobile UI like Karvis with a fully graphical interface and voice interactions would include:

Home Screen (Main Dashboard)

A futuristic, animated interface with a central AI avatar (could be a holographic head, an abstract AI core, or a 3D assistant).
Dynamic background with smooth animations and subtle UI transitions.
A circular or waveform-based voice activity indicator to show when the AI is speaking or listening.
Voice Interaction

The AI welcomes the user with a voice message when the app is launched (e.g., "Hello [User's Name], how can I assist you today?").
It listens for commands either through a wake word or by pressing a microphone button.
Responses are spoken back using a natural-sounding AI voice.
Graphical Elements

Live Data Widgets: Time, weather, notifications, battery percentage, system stats (for PC mode).
Holographic Effects: UI elements that give a sci-fi or HUD-like feel (e.g., glowing text, transparent overlays, animated circuits).
3D/2D Avatar: A customizable assistant that can visually react (eye movement, expressions, animations).
User Commands & Responses

Users can ask questions, control smart devices, check messages, or perform tasks (e.g., open apps, set reminders).
AI responds with a mix of voice and graphical elements, such as displaying weather info with animations.
Customization Options

Change UI colors, themes, and assistant voice.
Select different AI avatars or effects.
Would you like me to design a UI layout or provide a code implementation for any part of this?

# HOW TO RUN
To run your Jarvis UI React project, follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install required dependencies.

If you haven't initialized a React project:
Run this to create a new Next.js project:

sh
Copy
Edit
npx create-next-app@latest jarvis-ui
cd jarvis-ui
Then, install required dependencies.

2. Install Required Dependencies
Run the following command in your project directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm install react-speech-recognition axios html2canvas date-fns framer-motion lucide-react
3. Add Missing Dependencies
Your error mentions a missing react-speech-recognition. Install it using:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm install react-speech-recognition
4. Start the Development Server
Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will start a local server at http://localhost:3000/ where you can test your Jarvis UI.

5. Test Voice Commands
Make sure your browser allows microphone access. If the voice recognition doesnâ€™t work:

Try running the app in Google Chrome.
Check microphone permissions.
Restart the app.
6. Build for Production (Optional)
To create an optimized build:

sh
Copy
